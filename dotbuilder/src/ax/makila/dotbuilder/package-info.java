/**
 * Class for writing dot-graph output files. This class contains all the method needed for 
 * creating nodes, links and labels for dot-graphs. The dot language contains quite a few 
 * additional features but this library mostly contains the essentials. There is an option 
 * in this package to create the graph as well, which might be quite conventiont as then there
 * is no extra methods needed. However this has only been tested in Ubuntu and I can't guarantee
 * it will work. However the ouput file is basically a text file which can be rendered with dot.
